          Founded in 2016 by Madhava Hansen, Apartment Quirks is the original apartment review site. 
          We empower our users with knowledge about apartments to help them make 
          better choices when renting. After years of apartment hunting in NYC, we 
          decided there had to be a better way. So, we created a place where 
          renters could share their experiences about living in apartments. This 
          insider information is the meat and potatoes of what makes Apartment Quirks 
          so powerful for renters. It reduces the anxiety, the unknown, the worry that 
          comes along with blindly hoping the apartment you rented doesn’t have a laundry 
          list of hidden problems. Does the shower temperature change suddenly, are there 
          bug or rodent problems in the building, are the neighbors noisy, is the super 
          lazy? Don’t rent blindly, get to know your next apartment, before you sign a lease.
